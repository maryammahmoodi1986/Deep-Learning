# Deep-Learning
example 1: Work with structured data in deep learning
This example contains code for a machine learning project on the Covertype Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The main goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to predict the forest cover type based on various geographical and environmental features such as elevation, slope, distance to hydrology, and soil type.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or later
TensorFlow 2.12 or later
Pandas
Numpy
You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the code, you need to download the Covertype Data Set and save it as a gzip-compressed CSV file named q1-covtype.data.gz in the eyd directory.

Then, you can run the main.py script to train and evaluate the machine learning model. The script will output the evaluation metrics and save the trained model in the models directory.
